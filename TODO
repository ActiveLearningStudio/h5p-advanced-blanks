now: 
====

Bugfixes:
  * trim whitespaces of user input
  * hover over image --> no tooltip (bug in h5p library?)
  * resize event not handled correctly --> important for feedback popup  

Select mode:
  * select mode: random choice of other answers
  * select mode --> marking of correct / error not working

soon:
=====

* focus check button (Question.focusButton) when cloze is filled out entirely
* put Ractive into library
* show +1 / -1 score calculator
* implement xAPI
  * answered + answer serialization (= check all pressed) --> stores all answers
  * implement getXAPIData contract (for report rendering engines)
* simplify highlight markup in semantics (for incorrectAnswers & hint!)
* reimplement snippets

later:
======

* implement feedback ranges
* take over accessibility from h5p-blanks
* auto-growing text-fields

(re)consider if needed:
=======================

* react to resize event + send them when appropriate
* new setting: allow further editing after 'check' / disallow
* sanatise all user entered strings
* replace ractive with jquery views
* popup for (i) icon when notifying of surpressed popups?
