now: 
====

Select mode:
  * select mode: random choice of other answers

soon:
=====

* focus check button (Question.focusButton) when cloze is filled out entirely
* put Ractive into library
* position popups better (use privatre Question.positionFeedbackPopup / feedback / setExplanation)
* show no popups when using global check --> use clickable icons
* show +1 / -1 score calculator
* implement xAPI
  * answered + answer serialization (= check all pressed) --> stores all answers
  * interacted (= auto-check, simple event): check if this stores user state in h5p-blanks or if this is only done when pressing check 
  * implement getXAPIData contract (for report rendering engines)
* serialize & deserialize user state
* simplify highlight markup in semantics (for incorrectAnswers & hint!)
* reimplement snippets

later:
======

* Find out where H5P.TextUtilities comes from and use it instead of own Levenshtein implementation
* implement feedback ranges
* take over accessibility from h5p-blanks
* auto-growing text-fields

(re)consider if needed:
=======================

* react to resize event + send them when appropriate
* new setting: allow further editing after 'check' / disallow
* sanatise all user entered strings
* replace ractive with jquery views
