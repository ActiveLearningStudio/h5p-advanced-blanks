Observations in beta test:
======================
  ☐ was not/wasn't --> only was not is accepted as solution (it's not an issue with alternatives, though. It's must be about the apostrophe.)
  ☐ It would be useful to have a text pasting option that accepts regular blanks.
  ☐ Alternative markup should be / instead of ; to align the content with the normal h5p content type.
  ☐ It would be useful to have HTML markup in feedback texts.
  ☐ The 'case sensitive' option should be off by default.
  ☐ It would be useful to have an inbuilt language intelligence that can deal with typical issues:
      ☐ wrongly used apostrophes: ´` instead of '
      ☐ auto-alternatives for short forms (with option to disable it); requires intelligent checking of what is before the gap to avoid weird short forms like "Chris's done that before."
      ☐ auto-feedback for irregular verbs and typical misspellings
      ☐ autogeneration of incorrect answers for tenses which the content creator can select + generic auto-feedback texts defined by the user.
      ☐ autogeneration of incorrect answers for plural / singular
  ☐ Answer mode should become a regular option.
  ☐ Line high should not be 1.0. The touching boxes look bad.

High priority: 
==============

Bugfixes:
  ✔ trim whitespaces of user input
  ☐ hover over image --> no tooltip (bug in h5p library?)
  ☐ check if resize events are called and handled correctly   
      feedback popup sometimes is shifted to the wrong position if buttons become are visible
      reason is that its position is set as relative to the bottom, which changes after the popup was positioned
  ☐ select box / input box not long enough for long input --> overlap with symbols 
      requires an estimate of width by text length (should implemented in an isolated way)
  ✔ hide message surpression indicator when clicking retry
  ☐ empty feedback --> crash

Select mode:
  ☐ select mode: random choice of other answers
  ☐ feedback popup hidden by combobox
  
Medium priority:
================

☐ focus check button (Question.focusButton) when cloze is filled out entirely
☐ put Ractive into library
☐ implement xAPI
  ☐ answered + answer serialization (= check all pressed) --> stores all answers
  ☐ implement getXAPIData contract (for report rendering engines)
☐ reimplement snippets
☐ better tip icon
☐ feedback popup is too large --> auto-size

Low priority:
=============

☐ implement feedback ranges
☐ take over accessibility from h5p-blanks
☐ auto-growing text-fields

(re)consider if needed:
=======================

☐ react to resize event + send them when appropriate
☐ new setting: allow further editing after 'check' / disallow
☐ sanatise all user entered strings
☐ replace ractive with jquery views
☐ add highlight for hints
☐ hide tip icon if blank was answered correctly
☐ show "check" button in auto-answer mode when last gap is being filled (to avoid confusion of what to do at the end; user might not be aware of the concept of "losing focus")
☐ auto-check in select mode: does this work with keyboard select?
☐ if correct answer is: "Correct 1" and user enters "Correct " it is not considered a spelling mistake

done log:
=========

  ✔ clicking hint --> cloze is always marked as retry
  ✔ check mode --> spelling mistake: no marking of box
  ✔ dropdown icon is on top of other icons
  ✔ blank should revert to "neutral" state when it was wrong and is opened
  ✔ bug: empty selection --> line is too high
  ✔ no "check" button after it was pressed and there were errors (because the changed error blank aren't reset to neutral)
  ✔ select mode --> marking of correct / error not working
  ✘ show +1 / -1 score calculator
  ✔ simplify highlight markup in semantics (for incorrectAnswers)
  ✔ popup for (i) icon when notifying of surpressed popups?
