* think of a sensible way of splitting up cloze and general UI

* split deserializers and models
* translation strings escapes special characters: You&#039;ve made a spelling mistake.
* Implement buttons functionality
  * show solution
* implement auto-check when tabbing away
* disallow Enter when auto-check is false
* take over from h5p-blanks
  * introduction
  * image / video content on top + remove own implementation
* auto-growing text-fields
* react to resize event
* score widget
* feedback text
* select mode --> marking of correct / error not working
* select mode: random choice of other answers
* change highlight colors to h5p style
  
soon:
* put Ractive into library
* position popups better
* show +1 / -1 score calculator
* implement xAPI
  * notify about start
  * notify about entered answer
  * notify about check
  * notify about retry
  * send score
  * notify about ...?
  * read data when loading
* improve highlight markup in semantics (for incorrectAnswers & hint!)
* snippets
* Find out where H5P.TextUtilities comes from and use it instead of own Levenshtein implementation

later:
* accessibility
* position feedback popups over highlight if any
