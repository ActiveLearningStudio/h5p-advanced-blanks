now: 
====

Bugfixes:
  ☐ trim whitespaces of user input
  ☐ hover over image --> no tooltip (bug in h5p library?)
  ☐ resize event not handled correctly --> important for feedback popup    
  ☐ select box / input box not long enough for long input --> overlap with symbols
  ✔ check mode --> spelling mistake: no marking of box

Select mode:
  ☐ select mode: random choice of other answers
  ☐ feedback popup hidden by combobox
  ✔ dropdown icon is on top of other icons
  ✔ blank should revert to "neutral" state when it was wrong and is opened
  ✔ bug: empty selection --> line is too high
  ✔ no "check" button after it was pressed and there were errors (because the changed error blank aren't reset to neutral)
  ✔ select mode --> marking of correct / error not working
  
soon:
=====

☐ focus check button (Question.focusButton) when cloze is filled out entirely
☐ put Ractive into library
☐ implement xAPI
  ☐ answered + answer serialization (= check all pressed) --> stores all answers
  ☐ implement getXAPIData contract (for report rendering engines)
☐ reimplement snippets
☐ better tip icon
☐ feedback popup is too large --> auto-size
✘ show +1 / -1 score calculator
✔ simplify highlight markup in semantics (for incorrectAnswers)

later:
======

☐ implement feedback ranges
☐ take over accessibility from h5p-blanks
☐ auto-growing text-fields

(re)consider if needed:
=======================

☐ react to resize event + send them when appropriate
☐ new setting: allow further editing after 'check' / disallow
☐ sanatise all user entered strings
☐ replace ractive with jquery views
☐ add highlight for hints
☐ hide tip icon if blank was answered correctly
☐ show "check" button in auto-answer mode when last gap is being filled (to avoid confusion of what to do at the end; user might not be aware of the concept of "losing focus")
☐ auto-check in select mode: does this work with keyboard select?
✔ popup for (i) icon when notifying of surpressed popups?
