now: 

* select mode --> marking of correct / error not working
* select mode: random choice of other answers
* sanatise all user entered strings
* improve colours of popups
* retry button when finished in auto-check mode

soon:
* hover over image --> no tooltip (bug in h5p library?)
* put Ractive into library
* position popups better
* show no popups when using global check --> use clickable icons
* show +1 / -1 score calculator
* implement xAPI
  * notify about start
  * notify about entered answer
  * notify about check
  * notify about retry
  * send score
  * notify about ...?
  * read data when loading
* improve highlight markup in semantics (for incorrectAnswers & hint!)
* snippets
* Find out where H5P.TextUtilities comes from and use it instead of own Levenshtein implementation
* implement feedback ranges

later:
* accessibility
* position feedback popups over highlight if any
* auto-growing text-fields

reconsider if needed:
* react to resize event + send them when appropriate
* new setting: allow further editing after 'check' / disallow
